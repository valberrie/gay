# gay
a small program that prints a pride flag across a terminal

currently it will read the first argument from stdin to determine what flag to draw, and will draw an amount of 'spaces' based on the terminal size (columns). there are 4 flags available (pride, bi, trans, lesbian), and if invoked without any argument it will print the standard pride flag. for example if you want to print the trans flag, execute the program with "trans" as the first arg (without quotes).

todo:
  - actually parse arguments correctly lol
  - draw lines in a loop rather than repeating code
  - condense more
  - more colors and more flags

i initially made this just because i wanted to be able to type 'gay' anywhere and have it print a pride flag :3 lol. also a way to actually make something with C
